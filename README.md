## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am Gabriel Borges, a brazilian Computer Engineering student who likes to code.<br><br>

ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning more about Data Structures and Algorithms, as I have high interest in Competitive Programming.<br><br>

My repositories here in Github are still very simple, but I'm looking forward to make more complex stuff in the future.
