## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am Gabriel Borges, a second-year Computer Engineering student at UTFPR (Federal University of Technology - ParanÃ¡).<br>

I'm a guy who really enjoys technology and cracking hard problems.<br>

ðŸŒ± Currently, I'm focused on enhancing my skills to perform well in competitive programming contests, since I've already taken part of some and liked a lot.<br>

ðŸ”­ For the future, I plan to enrich my career by participating in an open-source project or by doing an internship to get real-world experience.<br>

Oh, and I use Arch btw
