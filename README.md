## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am Gabriel Borges, a second-year Computer Engineering student at UTFPR (Federal University of Technology - ParanÃ¡).<br>

I'm a guy who really enjoys technology and cracking hard problems.<br>

For me, programming is almost like "the next step of maths". It's a freeway for me to be useful, exercise my mind, entertain myself and get to know other people. I love it.
<br><br>


ðŸŒ± Currently, I'm focused on enhancing my skills to perform well in competitive programming contests, since I've already taken part of some and liked a lot.<br>

ðŸ”­ For the future, I plan to enrich my career by taking part of some open-source project or do an internship to get real-world experience.<br>

Oh, and I use Arch btw
